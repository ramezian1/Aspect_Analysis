# Aspect_Analysis
This project aims to perform Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) on customer reviews for the Apple iPhone 11. The goal is to identify specific features or aspects of the phone mentioned in the reviews (e.g., camera, battery life, screen) and determine the sentiment (Positive, Negative, or Neutral) expressed towards each aspect.
